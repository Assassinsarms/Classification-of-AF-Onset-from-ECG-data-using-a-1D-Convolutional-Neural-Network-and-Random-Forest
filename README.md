Classification of Atrial Fibrillation from ECG data using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forest

File name: Aaron_Mir_INM701_Coursework

This is the main code of the coursework. It is a Jupyter Notebook which contains 2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models made in Keras that were trialled during the  project in addition to a Random Forest classifier based on the Extra Trees classifier in Sci-kit learn. 

Out of the 2 CNNs, there is a small one with 1 convolutional layer and a larger one with 9 convolutional layers that requires a GPU to run. 

At the end of the file, there is an implementation of the Extra Trees classifier for the ECG data.

Performance metrics taken for all classifiers are the confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1 score.
